I built an end-to-end monitoring console for ATM and core systems, established solid delivery practices with Docker-based zero-downtime deployments, and improved developer and CI efficiency by moving the banking dashboard to Vite. I also secured critical integrations through a Go reverse proxy and multi-protocol ingress layer, defined the UI strategy for a Vue/TypeScript real-time data system with a tree-based exploration model and modular widget SDK, and drove healthy stakeholder cadence and team growth through clear communication, coaching and structured reviews.",
