# Token Middleware Analysis and Recommendations

Files:
- Legacy (pre-PR #77): pkg/http/middleware/token_middleware.go (removed)
- Current (v1): pkg/middleware/token_middleware.go
Date: 2025-08-08

---

## 1) What the legacy middleware did (pre-PR #77)

The TokenCheckMiddleware enforces a simple HMAC-based request authentication using three custom HTTP headers:

- X-API-Username: The account name registered in the system.
- X-API-Key: The public token (must have pk_ prefix and minimum length).
- X-API-Signature: An HMAC-SHA256 signature computed as HMAC(secret, accountName).

Processing flow:
1. Extracts and trims the three headers; rejects if any is empty.
2. Validates the public token format with auth.ValidateTokenFormat (checks min length and pk_/sk_ prefix).
3. Loads the API key record by account name (case-insensitive) from repository.ApiKeys.
4. Decrypts stored encrypted public/secret tokens using TokenHandler.DecodeTokensFor.
5. Verifies the provided public token equals the decrypted public token.
6. Computes a local signature via auth.CreateSignatureFrom(accountName, secretKey) and compares it to X-API-Signature.
7. On success, logs authentication success and calls the next handler; otherwise returns http.ApiError with Status 401 (generic message).

Notes:
- Secrets are stored encrypted-at-rest (AES-GCM).
- Client-facing errors are generic and do not echo credentials; sensitive details are only in server logs.

---

## 2) What it misses (gaps and limitations)

- No constant-time comparisons:
  - Direct string equality checks for token and signature can leak timing information.

- No replay protection:
  - Signature is static (HMAC(secret, accountName)). If intercepted, it can be replayed indefinitely.

- No request binding:
  - Signature isn’t tied to the specific request (method, path, body, timestamp). MITM can reuse it across endpoints.

- No timestamp and nonce:
  - Lacks X-API-Timestamp and X-API-Nonce to limit replay windows.

- Weak error semantics:
  - Returns 403 for all failures; should use 401 for unauthenticated and reserve 403 for authorization.

- Overly verbose error details:
  - Error messages include masked token/signature and exact account name; still reveals information to a client.

- No audience/scope/role concept:
  - Middleware only authenticates; it doesn’t propagate identity or scopes to downstream authorization.

- No context propagation:
  - Doesn’t set authenticated account/token metadata into request context for later use.

- No rate limiting or lockout:
  - Missing protection against credential stuffing or brute-force on account names.

- No key rotation strategy:
  - There’s no support for multiple active key versions or scheduled rotation.

- No IP/Origin policy:
  - Doesn’t check allowed IP ranges or allowed origins per account.

- Minimal logging / no correlation ID:
  - Logs success but lacks a request ID/correlation ID for tracing and reduced PII in logs.

- No transport security enforcement:
  - Middleware doesn’t enforce HTTPS/mTLS expectations (relies on deployment).

---

## 3) How we can improve it (actionable recommendations)

Quick wins (minimal impact):
- Constant-time compares:
  - Use hmac.Equal or subtle.ConstantTimeCompare for token and signature equality checks.

- Correct status codes:
  - Use 401 Unauthorized for auth failures; keep 403 for later authorization checks.

- Reduce error detail to clients:
  - Return generic messages like "Invalid credentials" without echoing account or tokens.
  - Keep detailed logs server-side with masked values.

- Propagate identity via context:
  - On success, set context values (accountName, apiKeyUUID) for downstream handlers.

- Structured logging and correlation ID:
  - Support/require an X-Request-ID header; log with structured fields and masked secrets.

Security hardening (medium impact):
- Request-bound HMAC signatures:
  - Require clients to sign a canonical string: method + path + query + timestamp + nonce + body-hash.
  - Validate within a short skew window (e.g., ±5 minutes) and reject reused nonces.

- Replay protection:
  - Add headers: X-API-Timestamp (epoch seconds) and X-API-Nonce (random UUID).
  - Track recent nonces per account in a short-lived store (in-memory or Redis) for the timestamp window.

- Input normalization:
  - Canonicalize header casing, path, and query param encoding consistently.

- Canonicalization rules (to prevent signature drift):
  - METHOD uppercased; PATH must be URI-normalized without dot-segments.
  - Percent-encode using RFC 3986 unreserved set; do not double-encode.
  - SORTED_QUERY_STRING sorts by key, then by value, both byte-wise ascending; multi-value params preserved in sorted order.
  - Collapse duplicate query separators; omit keys with empty names.
  - BODY hash is the SHA-256 of the exact bytes sent; for empty body use the hash of the empty string.
  - Header names are case-insensitive; trim surrounding whitespace on all header values.

- Rate limiting:
  - Rate limit auth failures per IP/account.

- Key rotation support:
  - Allow multiple active key versions; embed a key ID in the public key (e.g., pk_{kid}_{hash}) or add X-API-Key-ID.

- Tenant policy checks:
  - Optionally enforce allowed IP ranges and origins per account from DB policy.

Stronger assurance options (higher impact):
- mTLS for service-to-service:
  - Use client certs to authenticate server-to-server calls; keep HMAC as a second factor.

- OAuth 2.1 / OIDC for frontend apps:
  - Use Authorization Code with PKCE for browser/mobile; exchange for short-lived access token and refresh token.

- JWTs with short TTL:
  - Issue short-lived JWTs after initial key verification; then rely on JWT for subsequent requests.

- Web Application Firewall (WAF) and TLS enforcement:
  - Enforce HTTPS and add a WAF to mitigate common web attacks.

---

## 4) How it can be hacked (attack scenarios)

- Replay attacks:
  - Since the signature is static per account, an attacker capturing headers once can replay them forever.

- Timing attacks:
  - String equality may leak timing info, helping distinguish valid/invalid tokens/signatures.

- Credential stuffing / enumeration:
  - Uniform error messages but with different latencies can hint whether an account exists.

- MITM / downgrade:
  - If TLS is misconfigured, headers can be intercepted; without timestamp/nonce, replay is trivial.

- Logging leakage:
  - Logs include account names and could include masked tokens; misconfigured logging can leak sensitive info.

- No binding to request details:
  - A captured signature for one endpoint can be replayed on another since signature doesn’t include method/path/body.

- Lack of rate limiting:
  - Attackers can brute-force account names or spam requests without backpressure.

---

## 5) How we can pass less information to the frontend

- Don’t echo credentials:
  - Avoid returning account name, token, or signature in error messages. Use generic client-facing errors.

- Use server-generated correlation IDs:
  - Provide X-Request-ID to frontend for support without revealing auth details.

- Minimize fields in success responses:
  - Only include what the UI needs; avoid returning any API key metadata to the browser.

- Store secrets server-side only:
  - For browser apps, avoid exposing API keys; use session cookies or OAuth tokens instead.

- Differential logging:
  - Keep detailed diagnostics in server logs (masked), not in API responses.

---

## 6) How can we authenticate frontend apps better

For browser-based frontends (SPAs/MPAs):
- Prefer OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code with PKCE + OIDC:
  - Users authenticate with the IdP; the SPA exchanges the code for short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens via a BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) to avoid exposing refresh tokens to JS.

- Session cookies with SameSite=strict, HttpOnly, Secure:
  - Use server-managed sessions; issue short-lived session cookies and rotate session IDs frequently.

- Token lifetimes and rotation:
  - Access tokens 5–15 minutes; refresh tokens 7–30 days with rotation and revocation.

- BFF pattern:
  - The frontend talks to your BFF; the BFF calls the API with service credentials, keeping secrets off the browser.

For native apps or trusted server-to-server clients:
- mTLS:
  - Bind clients via mutual TLS certificates.

- Signed requests (HMAC) with request binding:
  - Include method, path, timestamp, nonce, and payload hash; enforce a skew window and nonce cache.

- Device-bound credentials:
  - Use secure enclave/Keychain/TPM to store tokens and bind them to devices.

## 8) Example canonical signature spec (for future adoption)

Headers required:
- X-API-Username
- X-API-Key
- X-API-Timestamp (epoch seconds)
- X-API-Nonce (UUID v4)
- X-API-Signature

Canonical request (string to sign):

METHOD + "\n" +
PATH + "\n" +
SORTED_QUERY_STRING + "\n" +
X-API-Username + "\n" +
X-API-Key + "\n" +
X-API-Timestamp + "\n" +
X-API-Nonce + "\n" +
SHA256_HEX(BODY)

Signature:
- signature = hex(HMAC-SHA256(secretKey, canonical_request))

Validation rules:
- Accept if |now - timestamp| <= 300s, nonce unused within window, and constant-time comparison passes.

---

## 9) Logging guidelines

- Never log full tokens or signatures. Use auth.SafeDisplay or stricter masking.
- Include: request_id, account_name (normalized), result (success/failure), reason codes, client_ip (if safe), user_agent (optional), path, method, and timing.
- Store detailed diagnostics server-side only; respond to clients with generic messages.

## 10) Deployment and runtime context (docker-compose, Caddy, Makefile)

Date: 2025-08-08 16:52 local

- Containers and networks (docker-compose.yml):
  - Services:
    - api: Go API built from docker/dockerfile-api; exposes ENV_HTTP_PORT (default 8080) to the caddy_net and oullin_net networks. DB host is api-db via Docker DNS. Secrets are injected using Docker secrets (pg_username, pg_password, pg_dbname).
    - api-db: Postgres 17.3-alpine. Port bound to 127.0.0.1:${ENV_DB_PORT:-5432} (not exposed publicly). Uses Docker secrets for credentials. Includes healthcheck and SSL files mounted read-only.
    - api-db-migrate: Runs migrations from database/infra/migrations via a wrapper script.
    - api-runner: Convenience container to run Go commands (e.g., seeders) with the code mounted at /app, sharing the network with api-db.
    - caddy_local (profile local): Reverse proxy for local development. Host ports 8080->80 and 8443->443. Caddyfile: caddy/Caddyfile.local.
    - caddy_prod (profile prod): Public reverse proxy/terminates TLS via Let’s Encrypt. Host ports 80/443 exposed. Caddyfile: caddy/Caddyfile.prod.
  - Networks:
    - caddy_net: Fronting proxy <-> API network.
    - oullin_net: Internal network for API <-> DB and runner.
  - Volumes:
    - caddy_data, caddy_config, oullin_db_data for persistence; go_mod_cache for cached modules in api-runner.

- Caddy local proxy (caddy/Caddyfile.local):
  - auto_https off (HTTP only locally).
  - Listens on :80 in the container (published as http://localhost:8080 on the host).
  - CORS: Allows Origin http://localhost:5173 and headers X-API-Username, X-API-Key, X-API-Signature, X-API-Timestamp, X-API-Nonce, X-Request-ID; handles OPTIONS preflight.
  - CORS: Exposes header X-Request-ID to clients.
  - reverse_proxy api:8080 — all paths are forwarded to API without an "/api" prefix.

- Caddy production proxy (caddy/Caddyfile.prod):
  - Site: oullin.io (automatic HTTPS).
  - API is routed under /api/* and proxied to api:8080. That means production API path = https://oullin.io/api/... while local is http://localhost:8080/....
  - CORS configured for https://oullin.io within the /api handler. For preflight, echoes Access-Control-Allow-Origin back.
  - Forwards key auth headers upstream (header_up Host, X-API-Username, X-API-Key, X-API-Signature, X-API-Timestamp, X-API-Nonce, X-Request-ID). X-Forwarded-For is also set by Caddy; the middleware’s ParseClientIP will prefer the first X-Forwarded-For entry.
  - CORS: Exposes header X-Request-ID to clients.

- Makefiles (metal/makefile/*.mk):
  - build-local (build.mk): docker compose --profile local up --build -d (starts api, api-db, caddy_local). After this, the API is reachable at http://localhost:8080.
  - db:up, db:seed, db:migrate (db.mk): Manage DB lifecycle and schema.
  - validate-caddy (app.mk): Format/validate local and production Caddyfiles.
  - env:init, env:check (env.mk): Initialize and verify .env from .env.example.

- API routes (metal/kernel/router.go):
  - POST /posts (list/filter posts) and GET /posts/{slug} (show post) are protected by TokenCheckMiddleware.
  - Other public static routes include /profile, /experience, /projects, /social, /talks, /education, /recommendations.
  - In production behind Caddy, the protected routes are under /api (e.g., POST https://oullin.io/api/posts). Locally through caddy_local they are at http://localhost:8080/posts.
